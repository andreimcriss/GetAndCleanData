## Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera Project

* Step 1: Download and unzip the source data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* Step 2: Copy the run_analysis.R to the same folder as the unziped source data

* Step 3: In RStudio set the working directory to the folder of the source data by running setwd("path_to_directory")

* Step 4: Run command: source("run_analysis.R")

* Step 5: Check out the output files: tidy_dataset.txt(dataset built according to the first 4 points of the project) and tidy_dataset2.txt(independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject)

Note: The script takes about 20 sec. to run on a 16GB system so it might take more then a minute on more slower systems.
